# Fine-Tuning-a-Generative-AI-Model
## Overview

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning process of a generative AI model using a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to optimize a pre-trained model to perform better on a specific dataset, improving accuracy, relevance, and coherence in generated outputs.

## Features

- Loading and preprocessing datasets for fine-tuning
- Applying transfer learning techniques to a generative AI model
- Evaluating model performance before and after fine-tuning
- Saving and exporting the fine-tuned model for future use
- Visualizing training metrics and loss curves

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on model)
- Transformers library (e.g., Hugging Face)
- NumPy & Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
